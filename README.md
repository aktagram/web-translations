# Aktagram website translations
These are the files that Aktagram will use for site translations


A. If you dont know how to use github well yet do this :
  1. Download (clone) en-us.yaml file.
  2. If the language file doesn't exist then open an issue with the title : Add 'French' language support.
  2. If the language file already exist, then just download that file and start translating from en-us.yaml to the language file you want to contribute
  3. Send your file or your new file(s) to contribute@aktagram.com with the subject: Add French language
  
For exemple : 
    Main file: 'en-us.yaml'
    The file you want to contribute: 'fr-fr.yaml' 
    Just copy lines from 'en-us.yaml' and past the lines you want to translate into 'fr-fr.yaml'.
    Now in the file 'fr-fr.yaml', translate only the text after the 'key', so after the ':'.
    Once done, save your translation file 'fr-fr.yaml' on your computer (anywhere you want).
    
B. You know how to use github ?
  1. Download the main file 'en-us.yaml'
  2. Download the file you want to contribute (if the file doesn't exist then open an issue)
  3. Start translating
  4. Once done, just send a pull request
